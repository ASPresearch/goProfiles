\title{Function to create expanded levels which can contain GO Terms at
  different GO levels}
\description{
This function, combined with function \code{expandTerm}, allows to
create mixed levels which can contain terms belonging to different GO
levels.
Specifically one can take one (or several, but one by one) term at a
given GO level and expand it into its children terms using function
expandTerm and then combine them into a new level using this function.
}
\usage{
expandedLevel(LevelTerms, Term2Expand, onto)
expandTerm(GOTerm, onto)
}
\arguments{
  \item{LevelTerms}{Other terms which have not been expanded, and will
    be combined with the expanded ones}
  \item{Term2Expand}{The GO term which will be substituted by its
    children terms}
  \item{GOTerm}{The GO term which will be substituted by its
    children terms}
  \item{onto}{The ontology ('MF','BP','CC'}
}
\value{
The value returned is the vector combining the original terms with the
children of the term that had to be expanded.
